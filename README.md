## FAQ
**My sounds are messed up after making config changes, what do I do?**

Turning off the plugin, logging out, then logging back in before (optionally) re-enabling the plugin should resolve this.

**Music doesn't resume seamlessly if I click back to the game.**

Setting music volume to 0 causes the current song to stop, and unfortunately the game doesn't start playing it again when unmuted.
I would suggest either muting music entirely or unselecting the "Mute music" option.

**This plugin made me die on my PvP only HCIM because I tabbed out and didn't hear that I was getting attacked!**
